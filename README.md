      who employed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance">nonviolent resistance</a> to lead the successful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement">campaign for India's independence</a>  from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj"> British rule</a>.
       He inspired movements for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movements"> civil rights</a> and freedom across the world. 
       The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_South_Africa"> South Africa</a> in 1914, is now used throughout the world. 
       Born and raised in a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus">Hindu</a>family in coastal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat">Gujarat</a>, Gandhi trained in the law at the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Temple">Inner Temple</a> in London and was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_the_bar">called to the bar</a> in June 1891, at the age of 22.
        After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit.
         He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. There, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. 
         In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive land-tax.</i></p></div></pre>
